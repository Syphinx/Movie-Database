Instructions    :
    1.	Navigate to the appropriate file directory in a CLI of your choosing.
    2.	Type and enter into the console “npm install” to install the necessary dependencies for this application.
    3.	Type and enter into the console "mongod --dbpath=database" to connect to the database.
    4.	To initialize the base state of the server, type into another console (not the one with an active connection to the database), “npm run db”, which runs two database initialization scripts sequentially. 
        These create initial documents and precomputes some information necessary for the rest of the application. Due to the nature of these scripts, the 2500 Movie set may take some time, but be assured it 
        DOES work and will load in the data after it is finished.
    5.	At this point, the server is ready to be launched, and is done by typing and entering into the console “npm run start”.
    6.  Initially, you will be greeted with the log in page, navigate to the signup page by selecting the button, and entering details to create a new account.
